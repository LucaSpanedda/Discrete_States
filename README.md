# Discrete_States

Discrete States is a sonic exploration that delves into the realm of algorithmic composition, drawing inspiration from the groundbreaking work of Karlheinz Stockhausen in Studie II. Embracing the ethos of creating an entire composition from a systematic foundation, Discrete States is a musical ecosystem governed by a discrete set of rules generated dynamically from a singular seed.
